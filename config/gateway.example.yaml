# Example API Gateway Configuration
# Copy this file to gateway.yaml and customize for your needs

server:
  # Server binding configuration
  host: "0.0.0.0"          # Listen on all interfaces
  port: 8080               # Gateway port
  read_timeout: 30s        # Maximum duration for reading request
  write_timeout: 30s       # Maximum duration for writing response
  shutdown_timeout: 10s    # Maximum time to wait for graceful shutdown

logging:
  # Logging configuration
  database: "gateway.db"   # SQLite database file for logs
  level: "info"            # Log level: debug, info, warn, error

rate_limiting:
  # Global rate limiting
  enabled: true            # Enable/disable rate limiting
  requests_per_second: 100 # Maximum requests per second
  burst: 50                # Maximum burst size

cors:
  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
  enabled: true
  allowed_origins: ["*"]   # Allowed origins (use ["*"] for all, or specific domains)
  allowed_methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"]
  allowed_headers: ["Origin", "Content-Type", "Accept", "Authorization"]

routes:
  # Define your routes here
  # Each route can have multiple backends for load balancing

  # Example: User service with load balancing
  - path: "/api/users/*"
    backends:
      - url: "http://localhost:9001"
        weight: 1          # Weight for load balancing (higher = more traffic)
      - url: "http://localhost:9002"
        weight: 1
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    rate_limit: 50         # Per-route rate limit (requests/second)

  # Example: Order service with single backend
  - path: "/api/orders/*"
    backends:
      - url: "http://localhost:9003"
        weight: 1
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
    rate_limit: 30

  # Example: External API proxy
  # - path: "/api/external/*"
  #   backends:
  #     - url: "https://api.example.com"
  #       weight: 1
  #   methods: ["GET"]
  #   rate_limit: 10
